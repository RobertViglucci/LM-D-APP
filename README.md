# Overview
This is my first ever Web3.0 D-app.

## Technologies and Languages used: 
JavaScript, HTML, Solidity, Three.js to render the land and generate the buildings being minted, Remix IDE (connected to Metamask) for smart contract deployment, and Ganache (connected to Metamask) to emulate a private Ethereum blockchain to perform my transactions on.

### DESC.
I decided to tackle this project after watching various youtube videos and learning about Web3.0, Solidity, Smart Contracts, and learning JavaScript. I got inspiration for this through a youtuber called "HashLips NFT". I used his smart contract from his Git Repository to save some time on my end. Instead of deploying it on the Polygon Matic blockchain like he did, I decided to implement Ganache so that I can have my own private emulated ETH blockchain therefore, I wouldnt have to pay each time I minted a new NFT in my Metaverse. This project took me approximatley 8 hours over a two day span after learning the technologies involved in this project. Majority of the time was spent debugging code so that I could successfully connect my JS file to Three.js and my smart contract. I am happy with the results considering this is my first Web3.0 D-app using new technologies and languages I havent used before transitioning off of Python as my main language of choice.
